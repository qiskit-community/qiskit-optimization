Optimizers (:mod:`qiskit_algorithms.optimizers`)
================================================
Classical Optimizers.

This package contains a variety of classical optimizers and were designed for use by
qiskit_algorithm's quantum variational algorithms, such as :class:`~qiskit_algorithms.VQE`.
Logically, these optimizers can be divided into two categories:

`Local Optimizers`_
  Given an optimization problem, a **local optimizer** is a function
  that attempts to find an optimal value within the neighboring set of a candidate solution.

`Global Optimizers`_
  Given an optimization problem, a **global optimizer** is a function
  that attempts to find an optimal value among all possible solutions.

Qiskit also provides the following optimizers, which are built-out using the optimizers from
`scikit-quant <https://scikit-quant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. The ``scikit-quant`` package
is not installed by default but must be explicitly installed, if desired, by the user. The
optimizers therein are provided under various licenses, hence it has been made an optional install.
To install the ``scikit-quant`` dependent package you can use ``pip install scikit-quant``.

Global Optimizers
-----------------
The global optimizers here all use `NLOpt <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for their
core function and can only be used if the optional dependent ``NLOpt`` package is installed.
To install the ``NLOpt`` dependent package you can use ``pip install nlopt``.
