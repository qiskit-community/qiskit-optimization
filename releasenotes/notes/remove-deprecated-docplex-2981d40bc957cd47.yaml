    The deprecated methods ``QuadraticProgram.from_docplex`` and
    ``QuadraticProgram.to_docplex`` have been removed and no longer exist.
    These methods were deprecated as part of the 0.2.0 release.
    Instead you should use :func:`~qiskit_optimization.translators.from_docplex_mp`
    and :func:`~qiskit_optimization.translators.to_docplex_mp`.
