upgrade:
  - |
    The support for ``QuantumInstance``-based algorithms is removed.
    Qiskit optimization supports only Primitive-based algorithms.
  - |
    The support for Opflow is removed to represent Ising Hamiltonians.
    Qiskit optimization supports only ``qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp``,
    instead.
  - |
    The classes ``VQEClient``, ``QAOAClient``, and ``VQERuntimeResult``
    are removed. Instead, users should migrate their code to use the Qiskit
    Runtime Primitives with session.
