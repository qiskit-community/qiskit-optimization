features:
  - |
    Simplifies :class`qiskit_optimization.algorithms.CplexOptimizer` by
    calling CPLEX from `docplex.mp.model.Model.solve` directly.
    Also adds a fallback code if no solution is found by CPLEX.
  - |
    Adds ``cplex_parameters`` as a dictionary to
    :class`qiskit_optimization.algorithms.CplexOptimizer`
    so that users can set parameters for CPLEX such as time limit
    and number of threads.
