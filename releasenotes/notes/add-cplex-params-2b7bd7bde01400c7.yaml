upgrade:
  - |
    Simplifies :class:`qiskit_optimization.algorithms.CplexOptimizer` by
    calling CPLEX from ``docplex.mp.model.Model.solve`` directly.
    Also adds a fallback code if no solution is found by CPLEX.
  - |
    Adds ``cplex_parameters`` as a dictionary to
    :class:`qiskit_optimization.algorithms.CplexOptimizer`
    so that users can set
    `CPLEX parameters <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/20.1.0?topic=cplex-parameters>`_
    such as time limit and number of threads.
