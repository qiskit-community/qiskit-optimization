features:
  - |
    Updated :func:`~.to_ising` to support optionally returning ``qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp``.
    This is achieved by a new ``opflow`` argument to :func:`~.to_ising` to control if the output is
    the Opflow operator, as has been done in the past,  (if ``True``) or ``SparsePauliOp`` (if ``False``).
    The default value of ``opflow`` argument is currently ``True``, but it will
    first be changed to ``False``. The parameter will be deprecated and removed in a future release.
  - |
    Updated :func:`~.from_ising` to support optionally accepting ``qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp``.
    The ``qubit_op`` argument can currently accept the Opflow operators (``OperatorBase`` type),
    but have been superseded by Qiskit Terra quantum_info ``BaseOperators`` such as
    ``SparsePauliOp``. The Opflow operator support will be deprecated in a future release
    and subsequently removed after that.
