    Updated :func:`~.to_ising` to support ``qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp``.
    Added ``opflow`` argument to :func:`~.to_ising` to control the output is
    opflow operator (if ``True``) or ``SparsePauliOp`` (if ``False``).
    The default value of ``opflow`` argument is currently ``True``, but it will
    first be changed to ``False`` and then deprecated in future releases.

    Updated :func:`~.from_ising` to support ``qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp``.
    ``qubit_op`` argument can currently accept opflow operators,
    but it has been superseded by ``SparsePauliOp``.
    Opflow will be deprecated in a future release and subsequently removed after that.
