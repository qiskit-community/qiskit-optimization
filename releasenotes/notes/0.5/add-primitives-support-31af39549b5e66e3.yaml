    Qiskit Optimization 0.5 supports the new algorithms introduced in Qiskit Terra 0.22
    which in turn rely on the `Qiskit Primitives <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/primitives>`_.
    Qiskit Optimization 0.5 still supports the former algorithms based on :class:`qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance`,
    but they will be deprecated and then removed, along with the support here, in future releases.

    The :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based algorithms
    (:class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.SamplingMinimumEigensolver` and
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`)
    as ``min_eigen_solver`` argument.
    The former algorithm :class:`qiskit.algorithms.MinimumEigensolver`
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases.
    Note that :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.SamplingVQE` supersedes
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.VQE` for :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer`.
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver` also supersedes
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`.

    The :class:`~.WarmStartQAOAOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based QAOA
    (:class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.QAOA`) as ``qaoa`` argument.
    The former algorithm :class:`qiskit.algorithms.QAOA`
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases.
