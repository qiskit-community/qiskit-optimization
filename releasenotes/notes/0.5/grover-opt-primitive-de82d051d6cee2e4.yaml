    The :class:`~.GroverOptimizer` class has a new keyword argument, ``sampler`` which is
    used to run the algorithm using an instance of the :class:`qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler`
    interface to calculate the results. This new argument supersedes the
    the ``quantum_instance`` argument and accordingly, ``quantum_instance``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in
    future releases.
