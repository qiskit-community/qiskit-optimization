    Rename the runtime "programs" to runtime "clients" to avoid name confusions and 
    reflect the fact that they are an interface for code executed in the cloud. The classes
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQEProgram`, 
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.QAOAProgram` and
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQEProgramResult` have been renamed to
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQEClient`,
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.QAOAClient` and
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQERuntimeResult`, respectively.
