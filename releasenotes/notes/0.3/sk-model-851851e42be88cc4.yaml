    Introduced the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model [1] :class:`qiskit_optimization.applications.SKModel`.
    The  model  has  all-to-all ferromagnetic  and  antiferromagnetic  interactions  given  by  a  random  disorder and
    represents a mean-field approximation of a spin glass.

    Let :math:`x\in\{\pm 1\}^n` be a configuration of spins. The SK model Hamiltonian on :math:`n` sites is

    .. math::
        \begin{array}{}
        H(x)=-1/\sqrt{n} \sum_{i<j} w_{i,j}x_ix_j,\text{ where } i,j\in [n],
        \end{array}

    :math:`w_{i,j}\in\{\pm 1\}` are called disorder and are chosen independently
    and uniformly at random.

    The computational problem associated with this class is to find the ground state
    of the SK Hamiltonian instance and its energy.
