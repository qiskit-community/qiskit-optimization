    Qiskit Optimization 0.5 supports the new algorithms introduced in Qiskit Terra 0.22
    which in turn rely on the `Qiskit Primitives <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html>`_.
    Qiskit Optimization 0.5 still supports the former algorithms based on ``QuantumInstance``,
    but they will be deprecated and then removed, along with the support here, in future releases.

features:
  - |
    The :class:`~.GroverOptimizer` class has a new keyword argument, ``sampler`` which is
    used to run the algorithm using an instance of the :class:`~.BaseSampler`
    interface to calculate the results. This new argument supersedes
    the ``quantum_instance`` argument and accordingly, ``quantum_instance``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in
    future releases.
  - |
    The :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based algorithms
    (``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.SamplingMinimumEigensolver`` and
    ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver``)
    as ``min_eigen_solver`` argument.
    The conventional algorithm ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers.MinimumEigensolver``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases.
    Note that ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.SamplingVQE`` supersedes
    ``qiskit.algorithms.VQE`` for :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer`.
    ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`` also supersedes
    ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`.

    The :class:`~.WarmStartQAOAOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based QAOA
    (``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.QAOA``) as ``qaoa`` argument.
    The conventional algorithm ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers.QAOA``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases.
