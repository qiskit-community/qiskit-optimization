    The :class:`~.GroverOptimizer` class has a new keyword argument, ``sampler`` which is
    used to run the algorithm using an instance of the :class:`~.BaseSampler`
    interface to calculate the results. This new argument supersedes
    the ``quantum_instance`` argument and accordingly, ``quantum_instance``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in
    future releases.

    The :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based algorithms
    (``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.SamplingMinimumEigensolver`` and
    ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver``)
    as ``min_eigen_solver`` argument.
    The conventional algorithms ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers.MinimumEigensolver``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases.
    Note that ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.SamplingVQE`` supersedes
    ``qiskit.algorithms.VQE`` for :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer`.

    The :class:`~.WarmStartQAOAOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based QAOA
    (``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.QAOA``) as ``qaoa`` argument.
    The conventional algorithm ``qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers.QAOA``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated
    and subsequently removed in future releases.
