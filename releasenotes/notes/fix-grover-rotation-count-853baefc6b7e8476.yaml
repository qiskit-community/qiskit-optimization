fixes:
  - |
    Fixes ``rotation_count`` in :class:`qiskit_optimization.algorithms.GroverOptimizer`.
    This fix uses ``algorithm_globals.random.integers(0, m)`` to generate a random integer
    in a range 0..m-1.
  - |
    Sorts the order of ``result.get_counts(qc)`` by bitstring
    in :class:`qiskit_optimization.algorithms.GroverOptimizer` when ``qasm_simulator`` is used
    so that the algorithm behaves deterministically.
    The previous version sorts the counts by probabilities, but some bitstrings may have
    the same probability and the algorithm could behave probabilistically.
