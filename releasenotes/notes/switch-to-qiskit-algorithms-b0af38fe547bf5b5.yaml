    Qiskit Optimization 0.6 switches from ``qiskit.algorithms`` of Qiskit Terra
    to `Qiskit Algorithms <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/algorithms/>`_.
    Qiskit Optimization 0.6 drops supports of the former algorithms based on
    ``qiskit.algorithms`` and ``QuantumInstance`` of Qiskit Terra.

features:
  - |
    The :class:`~.MinimumEigenOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based algorithms
    (:class:`qiskit_algorithms.SamplingMinimumEigensolver` and
    :class:`qiskit_algorithms.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`)
    of `Qiskit Algorithms <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/algorithms/>`_
    as ``min_eigen_solver`` argument.
    The supports of the former algorithms based on ``qiskit.algorithms`` and ``QuantumInstance``
    are removed.
  - |
    The :class:`~.WarmStartQAOAOptimizer` class takes the primitives-based QAOA
    (:class:`qiskit_algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.QAOA`) as ``qaoa`` argument.
    The support of the former QAOA algorithms based on ``qiskit.algorithms`` is removed.
  - |
    The :class:`~.GroverOptimizer` class drops the support of ``QuantumInstance``
    and argument `quantum_instance` is removed. It supports only the Sampler primitive now.
