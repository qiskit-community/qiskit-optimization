    Qiskit Optimization 0.7 introduces significant architectural improvements focused on 
    enhanced independence and modern primitives support. This release eliminates the 
    dependency on qiskit-algorithms by migrating essential components directly into 
    qiskit-optimization, ensuring better long-term stability and reducing external 
    dependencies.
    
    The most notable change is comprehensive support for Qiskit's V2 Primitives 
    (BaseEstimatorV2 and BaseSamplerV2), which are the foundation for future quantum computing workflows.
    All minimum eigensolvers including VQE, QAOA, SamplingVQE, and specialized algorithms like QRAO and GroverOptimizer now
    seamlessly support both V1 and V2 primitives with automatic detection.
    
    Key migrated components from qiskit-algorithms include essential optimizers (COBYLA, 
    NELDER_MEAD, SciPyOptimizer, SPSA), minimum eigensolvers (VQE, QAOA, SamplingVQE, 
    NumPyMinimumEigensolver), and utility functions (algorithm_globals). These components 
    are now maintained directly within qiskit-optimization, ensuring consistent updates 
    and optimization-specific enhancements.
    
    While V1 Primitives remain functional with deprecation warnings, users are strongly 
    encouraged to migrate to V2 Primitives for optimal performance. The migration is 
    straightforward but requires attention to pass manager requirements for hardware and 
    simulator backends.
    A comprehensive `migration guides <https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-optimization/migration/index.html>`_
    is provided to assist users in updating their code.
    
    This release maintains full backward compatibility while positioning Qiskit 
    Optimization for future developments in the quantum optimization ecosystem.
