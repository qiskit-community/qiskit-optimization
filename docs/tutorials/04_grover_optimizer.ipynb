    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover Adaptive Search (GAS) has been explored as a possible solution for combinatorial optimization problems, alongside variational algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The algorithm iteratively applies Grover Search to find the optimum value of an objective function, by using the best-known value from the previous run as a threshold. The adaptive oracle used in GAS recognizes all values above or below the current threshold (for max and min respectively), decreasing the size of the search space every iteration the threshold is updated, until an optimum is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore each component of the `GroverOptimizer`, which utilizes the techniques described in GAS, by minimizing a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, as described in [1]\n",

    "Grover Search, the core element of GAS, needs three ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A state preparation operator $A$ to construct a superposition of all states in the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An oracle operator $O$, that recognizes the states of interest and multiplies their amplitudes by -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Grover diffusion operator $D$, that multiplies the amplitude of the $|0\\rangle_n$ state by -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "While implementations of GAS vary around the specific use case, the general framework still loosely follows the steps described below.\n",

    "```GroverOptimizer``` uses ```QuadraticProgramToNegativeValueOracle``` to construct $A_y$ such that it prepares a $n$-qubit register to represent the equal superposition of all $|x\\rangle_n$ and a $m$-qubit register to (approximately) represent the corresponding $|Q(x)-y\\rangle_m$. Then, all states with $(Q(x) - y)$ negative should be flagged by $O_y$. Note that in the implementation discussed, the oracle operator is actually independent of $y$, but this is not a requirement. For clarity, we will refer to the oracle as $O$ when the oracle is independent of $y$.\n",

    "where $|x\\rangle$ is the binary encoding of the integer $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration in which the threshold $y$ is updated, we adapt $A_y$ such that the function values are shifted up or down (for minimum and maximum respectively) by $y$. For example, in the context of finding the minimum, as the value of $y$ decreases, the search space (negative values) also decreases, until only the minimum value remains. A concrete example will be explored in the next section."
