**Qiskit Optimization** is an open-source framework that covers the whole range from high-level modeling of optimization
problems, with automatic conversion of problems to different required representations, to a suite
of easy-to-use quantum optimization algorithms that are ready to run on classical simulators,
as well as on real quantum devices via Qiskit.

The Optimization module enables easy, efficient modeling of optimization problems using
[docplex](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc/).
A uniform interface as well as automatic conversion between different problem representations
allows users to solve problems using a large set of algorithms, from variational quantum algorithms,
such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA, to Grover Adaptive Search using the
GroverOptimizer
leveraging fundamental algorithms provided by Terra. Furthermore, the modular design
of the optimization module allows it to be easily extended and facilitates rapid development and
testing of new algorithms. Compatible classical optimizers are also provided for testing,
validation, and benchmarking.

## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit Optimization via the pip tool (a python package manager).

```bash
pip install qiskit-optimization
```

**pip** will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest
(and well-tested) version.

If you want to work on the very latest work-in-progress versions, either to try features ahead of
their official release or if you want to contribute to Optimization, then you can install from source.
To do this follow the instructions in the
 [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/optimization/getting_started.html#installation).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Optional Installs

* **IBM CPLEX** may be installed using `pip install 'qiskit-optimization[cplex]'` to enable the reading of `LP` files and the usage of
  the `CplexOptimizer`, wrapper for ``cplex.Cplex``. Currently there is no python 3.9 version of CPLEX. In this case, the CPLEX install
  command will have no effect.

* **CVXPY** may be installed using command `pip install 'qiskit-optimization[cvx]'` to install the
  package. CVXPY being installed will enable the usage of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm as an optimizer `GoemansWilliamsonOptimizer`.

* **Matplotlib** may be installed using command `pip install 'qiskit-optimization[matplotlib]'` to install the
  package. Matplotlib being installed will enable the usage of the `draw` method in the graph optimization application classes.

* **Gurobipy** may be installed using command `pip install 'qiskit-optimization[gurobi]'` to install the
  package. Gurobipy being installed will enable the usage of the GurobiOptimizer.

### Creating Your First Optimization Programming Experiment in Qiskit

Now that Qiskit Optimization is installed, it's time to begin working with the optimization module.
Let's try an optimization experiment to compute the solution of a
[Max-Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut). The Max-Cut problem can be formulated as
quadratic program, which can be solved using many several different algorithms in Qiskit.
In this example, the MinimumEigenOptimizer
is employed in combination with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as minimum
eigensolver routine.

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

from qiskit_optimization import QuadraticProgram
from qiskit_optimization.algorithms import MinimumEigenOptimizer

from qiskit import BasicAer
from qiskit.algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import SPSA

# Generate a graph of 4 nodes
n = 4
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_nodes_from(np.arange(0, n, 1))
elist = [(0, 1, 1.0), (0, 2, 1.0), (0, 3, 1.0), (1, 2, 1.0), (2, 3, 1.0)]
graph.add_weighted_edges_from(elist)

# Compute the weight matrix from the graph
w = nx.adjacency_matrix(graph)

# Formulate the problem as quadratic program
problem = QuadraticProgram()
_ = [problem.binary_var('x{}'.format(i)) for i in range(n)]  # create n binary variables
linear = w.dot(np.ones(n))
quadratic = -w
problem.maximize(linear=linear, quadratic=quadratic)

# Fix node 0 to be 1 to break the symmetry of the max-cut solution
problem.linear_constraint([1, 0, 0, 0], '==', 1)

# Run quantum algorithm QAOA on qasm simulator
spsa = SPSA(maxiter=250)
backend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
qaoa = QAOA(optimizer=spsa, reps=5, quantum_instance=backend)
algorithm = MinimumEigenOptimizer(qaoa)
result = algorithm.solve(problem)
print(result)  # prints solution, x=[1, 0, 1, 0], the cost, fval=4
```

### Further examples

Learning path notebooks may be found in the
[optimization tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/optimization/tutorials/index.html) section
of the documentation and are a great place to start.
